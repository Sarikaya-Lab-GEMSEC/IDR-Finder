# IDR-Finder
What is IDR-finder about?
In general, once you have several sequences of amino acids and search for all the intrinsically disordered regions, you may want to use IDR finder for help. By taking in a csv file which contains a column of amino acid sequences, called 'Sequence', in the same directory as 'IDR-Finder.py', this programs would finally output another csv file called 'output' containg both intrinsically disordered regions' patterns and the names of sequence which they are from.
